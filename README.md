# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I am Era! I want to be a Product Manager. I think one of the skills you require as a Product Manager is story telling. And what's even better is if you can back it up with data. So, here I am trying to learn how to tell stories with data!

# What I hope to learn

1. Effectively Communicate Data Insights: Learn how to present complex data in a way that is understandable and engaging for any audience. 
2. Data Visualization Techniques: Gain skills in selecting the right charts, graphs, and visual elements to highlight key data points. 
3. Storytelling with Data: Understand how to craft a narrative around data to emphasize important insights and make the information memorable. 
4. Avoiding Misleading Visualizations: Learn how to design ethical and accurate visualizations that convey data truthfully. 
5. Using Context to Enhance Understanding: Explore ways to add context to data visuals, making sure viewers interpret the data accurately and meaningfully.
