# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi!  I am Era! I want to be a Product Manager. I think one of the skills you require as a Product Manager is story telling. And what's even better is if you can back it up with data. So, here I am trying to learn how to tell stories with data!
