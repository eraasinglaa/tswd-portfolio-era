# Changes made since Part II
Since completing Part II of the final project, several significant changes have been implemented to enhance the story and improve its impact on the target audience of policymakers:

1. Refined focus: The narrative has been streamlined to emphasize the economic and academic contributions of international students, particularly from China and India, as these countries account for 54% of international students in the USA.

2. Enhanced data visualizations: The enrollment trends graph has been improved to highlight key fluctuations caused by global events and policy changes. A new visualization showcasing the economic impact of international students by state has been added to provide a more compelling argument for policymakers.

3. Personal element: To address the lack of emotional appeal noted in Part II feedback, personal quotes from international students have been incorporated, sharing their experiences and challenges.

4. Challenges section: A new section detailing the specific challenges faced by international students has been added, using real examples to create a more empathetic narrative.

5. Call to action: The final section has been restructured to provide clear, actionable recommendations for policymakers, directly addressing the primary audience of the project.

These changes have resulted in a more focused, data-driven, and emotionally resonant story that better serves the goal of informing and influencing policymakers on the importance of international students in the USA.

## The audience
The primary audience for this project is policymakers, as they have the authority to implement changes that significantly impact international students' experiences and opportunities in the USA. Policymakers are crucial for several reasons:

1. They control funding and resources for international education programs.
2. They shape visa regulations and immigration policies directly affecting international students.
3. They can develop strategies to maintain the USA's competitiveness in attracting global talent.

However, the project can also resonate with broader audiences:

1. University administrators and faculty can use this information to improve support services and programs for international students.
2. Current and prospective international students can gain insights into trends and opportunities in U.S. higher education.
3. The general public can better understand the value international students bring to their communities and the nation as a whole.

By addressing these broader audiences, the project can foster a more comprehensive understanding of the importance of international students, potentially creating grassroots support for policies that benefit this group. This approach ensures that while the primary focus remains on influencing policymakers, the story remains accessible and relevant to a wider range of stakeholders in the international education ecosystem.

## Adjustments for the audience
To tailor the content for policymakers, several key adjustments were made to the project:

1. Emphasis on Economic Impact: The visualization of economic contributions by state was prominently featured, highlighting the significant financial benefits international students bring to the U.S. economy. This data-driven approach appeals to policymakers' focus on economic growth and job creation.

2. Long-term Diplomatic Benefits: The project emphasized how international students often become future leaders in their home countries, fostering positive long-term diplomatic relations with the U.S. This perspective aligns with policymakers' interest in soft power and international relations.

3. Policy Recommendations: A dedicated section on "Call to Action" was included, offering specific, actionable policy recommendations. These suggestions were designed to be implementable and relevant to policymakers' spheres of influence.

4. Addressing Challenges: The project included a section on challenges faced by international students, framed in a way that illustrates potential areas for policy intervention and improvement.

These adjustments were made to ensure the content resonates with policymakers' priorities and provides them with the information needed to make informed decisions regarding international students in the USA.

## Final design decisions
Based on your project on international students in the USA, here are the key design decisions you've made, along with some additional considerations:

1. Visual Theme: Using the American flag as a background image in select sections creates a strong visual connection to the USA, reinforcing the context of your story.

2. Color Scheme: Incorporating the blue from the American flag in solid backgrounds maintains consistency with the overall theme and enhances visual cohesion.

3. Imagery Selection: Choosing images that complement and enhance the text helps tell the story more effectively, making complex information more accessible and engaging.

4. Typography: Maintaining a consistent font throughout the story improves readability and creates a professional, cohesive look.

5. Data Visualization: Showcasing jobs and economic contributions by state through a map or chart highlights the local impact of international students, potentially influencing state-level policies.

6. Information Hierarchy: Using varying text sizes, bold fonts, or color accents to guide readers through the most important points of your story.

7. Interactive Elements: Including hover effects or clickable elements in your visualizations to encourage user engagement and exploration of the data.

These design decisions collectively create a visually appealing, cohesive, and informative presentation that effectively communicates the impact of international students in the USA.

## Learnings
Throughout this project on international students in the USA, I gained valuable insights into the art of data visualization and storytelling. One of the most significant learnings was the importance of balancing quantitative data with personal narratives. While economic statistics and enrollment trends provided a solid foundation, incorporating individual student experiences brought the story to life and made it more relatable to the audience.
Another crucial lesson was the challenge of simplifying complex information for policymakers without losing the nuance of the topic. I learned to prioritize key data points and present them in visually appealing ways, such as using interactive maps and charts. This process highlighted the power of effective data visualization in making intricate information accessible and compelling. Additionally, I discovered the importance of tailoring the narrative to the specific needs and interests of policymakers, focusing on aspects like economic impact and long-term diplomatic benefits that resonate with their priorities.

# Final thoughts
> Reflecting on the process of creating this project on international students in the USA, I've gained valuable insights into data visualization and storytelling. The journey from initial concept to final presentation has been both challenging and rewarding. One of the most significant learnings was the importance of balancing quantitative data with personal narratives to create a compelling story. I found myself particularly excited about showcasing the economic and cultural contributions of international students, as these aspects often go unrecognized. However, I wish I had more time to delve deeper into the long-term impacts of international education on diplomatic relations and global understanding. If given the opportunity, I would like to explore more individual success stories of international students who have made significant contributions to their fields after graduating. Overall, this project has reinforced the power of data visualization in communicating complex issues and the importance of tailoring content to a specific audience, in this case, policymakers.
