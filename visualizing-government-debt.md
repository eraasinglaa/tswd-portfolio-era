## Part one: Working with web-based visualization tools and data

## Working with Tableau

_A reminder that to get the Tableau visualization to render correctly on Github, you'll have to do a bit of editing of the code block once you paste it here.  As before, make sure to walk us through what you did in Tableau, and any thoughts or observations, etc._

## Part three: create your own visualization

_Create another data visualization using the same data used earlier. DO NOT submit something that's just a minor modification of one of the visualizations already covered here. So, don't just modify the colors or labels of one of the earlier examples and call it good, or submit a slightly modified bar chart.  Instead, see what you can come up with on your own, and spend some time to try and create something that tells a story about the data._

_Summarize in a paragraph or two about the different methods of visualization, and how they compare / contrast to one another. Make sure you include all source information and explain the data well.  Talk about why you chose the third data visualization.  Be specific - keep your writeup relevant to the assignment, and avoid jargon-filled language that doesn't say anything useful._

_It's a good idea to go back and review your work.  Could someone follow your process and understand what you did?  Do you need to further connect any of the sections with a bit of text?  Is it something you'd be happy to have as an example of your work from the class?_

# Government Debt Trends Over Time: USA vs. Major Global Economies

## Visualization Overview

This visualization compares government debt as a percentage of GDP across the United States and other major global economies from 1995 to 2019. The purpose of this comparison is to illustrate how different countries manage their debt levels over time, particularly in response to significant global economic events, such as the 2008 financial crisis. By focusing on both high-debt and low-debt countries, this chart provides insights into the varied fiscal policies and economic resilience of different nations in comparison to USA.

## Story Behind the Data

This visualization tells a story of **economic diversity and response to crises**. The selected countries represent a range of fiscal policies, from high-debt tolerance to low-debt conservatism. Each country's government debt as a percentage of GDP reveals how it has responded to both global and domestic economic pressures.

- **Japan (JPN)** stands out as having the highest debt-to-GDP ratio, consistently surpassing 200% in recent years. This is largely due to Japan’s unique economic policies and the challenges of an aging population, which increase government spending on social services.
- **Estonia (EST)**, on the other hand, maintains one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios. This demonstrates a conservative fiscal approach, where the government relies less on debt financing, indicating a contrasting policy to that of Japan.
- **USA (USA)** shows a steady increase in debt, with notable spike during the 2008 financial crisis. These spikes reflect the US government’s approach of increasing spending to stabilize the economy during periods of crisis.
- **European Economies** like **Germany (DEU)**, **France (FRA)**, and the **United Kingdom (GBR)** have debt levels that vary, showing moderate increases. Germany, in particular, maintains relatively lower debt levels, while the UK and France display debt trends similar to the USA, with noticeable increases during recent crises.

This visualization highlights the varied fiscal responses and economic resilience of different countries in managing government debt, providing a global perspective on debt dynamics.

## Why These Countries Were Chosen

The selected countries represent a balanced and diverse range of economic policies and debt levels:

- **Japan (JPN)**: Known for its high debt-to-GDP ratio, representing a high-debt tolerance model.
- **Estonia (EST)**: Known for its low debt levels, representing a conservative fiscal policy.
- **USA (USA)**: A large economy with a moderate but rising debt profile, reflecting active fiscal intervention during crises.
- **Germany (DEU), France (FRA), United Kingdom (GBR)**: Major European economies with varying debt policies, representing different responses within the European region.
- **Canada (CAN)**: Provides a North American perspective alongside the USA, showing a moderate debt approach similar to European economies.

This selection captures a wide spectrum of debt management strategies, from high-debt tolerance to low-debt conservatism, and provides a comprehensive view of government debt management across regions and economic statuses.

## Chart Description

This line chart presents government debt as a percentage of GDP over time (1995–2019). Each line represents a different country, with distinct colors used to differentiate key countries in the story:

- **Red (Japan)**: Indicates consistently high debt levels.
- **Green (Estonia)**: Represents the lowest debt levels, providing a sharp contrast with high-debt nations.
- **Blue (USA)**: Shows moderate but increasing debt levels, highlighting the impact of economic crises.
- **Gray tones (Other countries)**: Used for Canada, Germany, France, and the UK, which display varied debt levels within the middle range.

### Key Annotations

- **2008 Global Financial Crisis**: A vertical line is added at 2008 to indicate the financial crisis, during which debt levels spiked for most countries, as governments increased spending to stabilize their economies.

This annotation help provide context for the spikes in debt, allowing viewers to understand the external events that influenced these trends.

## Insights and Conclusions

This visualization demonstrates how different countries approach debt management and the impact of global events on government borrowing. Countries like **Japan** have sustained high debt levels without significant instability, largely due to domestic factors like low interest rates and strong internal demand for debt. In contrast, **Estonia’s low debt levels** suggest a cautious approach, with the government avoiding large-scale borrowing. **The USA and the UK** show similar patterns, with debt levels rising notably during economic crises, reflecting active fiscal responses.

By comparing these countries, this visualization provides a global perspective on government debt, highlighting the resilience or vulnerability of economies to high debt and the impact of key economic events on fiscal policies.
