# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience for this project on international students in the USA includes:

- University administrators and policymakers involved in international education
- Current and prospective international students
- Domestic students interested in global perspectives
- General public interested in higher education trends

To identify representative individuals, I plan to reach out to:
- 1-2 university staff members working in international student services
- 1-2 current international students 
- 1 domestic student involved in international student organizations

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand perceptions of international student contributions | - What do you see as the main benefits of having international students in US universities?<br>- How do you think international students impact campus diversity and cultural exchange? |
| Gauge awareness of trends and challenges | - What trends have you noticed in international student enrollment in recent years?<br>- What do you think are the biggest challenges facing international students in the US? |
| Identify areas of interest for data visualization | - What aspects of international student data would you find most interesting or useful to see visualized?<br>- Are there any misconceptions about international students that you think data could help clarify? |
| Assess the effectiveness of current storytelling | - Based on the storyboard, what parts of the narrative are most compelling to you?<br>- Is there any information you feel is missing or could be expanded upon? |

## Interview findings

| Questions | Interview 1 (University Administrator) | Interview 2 (International Student) | Interview 3 (Domestic Student) |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Main benefits of international students | "They bring diverse perspectives and contribute significantly to research and innovation." | "We help create a global learning environment and often contribute economically to our communities." | "International students expose us to different cultures and prepare us for a globalized workplace." |
| Noticed trends | "We've seen fluctuations due to policy changes and global events like the pandemic." | "There seems to be more competition from other countries for international students." | "I've noticed more diversity in where international students come from compared to a few years ago." |
| Interesting data to visualize | "Economic impact by state and trends in fields of study over time." | "Visa approval rates and how they correlate with enrollment numbers." | "Distribution of international students across different types of institutions." |
| Most compelling part of storyboard | "The section on economic contributions really stands out." | "I appreciate the focus on cultural exchange and diversity." | "The historical context helps put current trends in perspective." |
| Missing information | "It would be good to include more on support services for international students." | "Maybe add some personal stories or quotes from international students." | "Information on post-graduation outcomes for international students could be interesting." |

# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis | Anticipated changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Economic impact is compelling | Expand the economic impact section with more detailed visualizations by state and over time |
| Interest in visa and policy impacts | Add a section on how visa policies have affected enrollment trends |
| Desire for personal elements | Incorporate quotes or brief case studies from international students |
| Need for context on support services | Include information on university support services for international students |
| Interest in post-graduation outcomes | Add data on career outcomes or further study for international graduates if available |

Based on the user research conducted, several key insights have emerged that will help refine and improve the project on international students in the USA. The feedback from diverse perspectives - including university administrators, international students, and domestic students - has provided valuable direction for enhancing the story's impact and relevance.

# Moodboards / personas
To better understand and visualize the target audience for my project on international students in the USA, I've created a moodboard/persona. This visual representation helps capture the essence of the international student experience, including their aspirations, challenges, and cultural diversity. The moodboard/persona incorporates elements such as educational symbols, cultural icons, and imagery related to global mobility and cross-cultural exchange. This visual aid serves as a reference point for designing my project's aesthetics and ensuring that the content resonates with the intended audience.
