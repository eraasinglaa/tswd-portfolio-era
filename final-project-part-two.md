# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience for this project on international students in the USA includes:

- University administrators and policymakers involved in international education
- Current and prospective international students
- Domestic students interested in global perspectives
- General public interested in higher education trends

To identify representative individuals, I plan to reach out to:
- 1-2 university staff members working in international student services
- 1-2 current international students 
- 1 domestic student involved in international student organizations

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Understand perceptions of international student contributions | - What do you see as the main benefits of having international students in US universities?<br>- How do you think international students impact campus diversity and cultural exchange? |
| Gauge awareness of trends and challenges | - What trends have you noticed in international student enrollment in recent years?<br>- What do you think are the biggest challenges facing international students in the US? |
| Identify areas of interest for data visualization | - What aspects of international student data would you find most interesting or useful to see visualized?<br>- Are there any misconceptions about international students that you think data could help clarify? |
| Assess the effectiveness of current storytelling | - Based on the storyboard, what parts of the narrative are most compelling to you?<br>- Is there any information you feel is missing or could be expanded upon? |

## Interview findings

| Questions | Interview 1 (University Administrator) | Interview 2 (International Student) | Interview 3 (Domestic Student) |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Main benefits of international students | "They bring diverse perspectives and contribute significantly to research and innovation." | "We help create a global learning environment and often contribute economically to our communities." | "International students expose us to different cultures and prepare us for a globalized workplace." |
| Noticed trends | "We've seen fluctuations due to policy changes and global events like the pandemic." | "There seems to be more competition from other countries for international students." | "I've noticed more diversity in where international students come from compared to a few years ago." |
| Interesting data to visualize | "Economic impact by state and trends in fields of study over time." | "Visa approval rates and how they correlate with enrollment numbers." | "Distribution of international students across different types of institutions." |
| Most compelling part of storyboard | "The section on economic contributions really stands out." | "I appreciate the focus on cultural exchange and diversity." | "The historical context helps put current trends in perspective." |
| Missing information | "It would be good to include more on support services for international students." | "Maybe add some personal stories or quotes from international students." | "Information on post-graduation outcomes for international students could be interesting." |

# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis | Anticipated changes for Part III |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| Economic impact is compelling | Expand the economic impact section with more detailed visualizations by state and over time |
| Interest in visa and policy impacts | Add a section on how visa policies have affected enrollment trends |
| Desire for personal elements | Incorporate quotes or brief case studies from international students |
| Need for context on support services | Include information on university support services for international students |
| Interest in post-graduation outcomes | Add data on career outcomes or further study for international graduates if available |

Based on the user research conducted, several key insights have emerged that will help refine and improve the project on international students in the USA. The feedback from diverse perspectives - including university administrators, international students, and domestic students - has provided valuable direction for enhancing the story's impact and relevance.

# Moodboards / personas
To better understand and visualize the target audience for my project on international students in the USA, I've created a moodboard/persona. This visual representation helps capture the essence of the international student experience, including their aspirations, challenges, and cultural diversity. The moodboard/persona incorporates elements such as educational symbols, cultural icons, and imagery related to global mobility and cross-cultural exchange. This visual aid serves as a reference point for designing my project's aesthetics and ensuring that the content resonates with the intended audience.
